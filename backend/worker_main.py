"""Standalone job-worker entrypoint (no HTTP API).

Runs the same claim → fork → optimize pipeline as the in-process worker,
against the shared Postgres queue, without loading the FastAPI app or its
routers. Deploy as its own service — with the API pods set to
``WORKER_ENABLED=0`` — to split job memory from request traffic:

    python worker_main.py

Scale by adding replicas: ``claim_next_job`` (``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``)
already coordinates peers, and the orphan sweeper is advisory-locked so only
one replica per tick does recovery work.
