"""Forward operational alerts to a chat webhook and/or an operator inbox.

The backend already logs the things an operator needs to know about — an
unhandled 500, a dead worker, a balance below its floor — but on a hosted
deployment those log lines scroll past unwatched. This module forwards the
important ones to an incoming chat webhook so a human actually sees them.

Two entry points:

* :class:`AlertLogHandler` — a logging handler that forwards every record at or
  above ``ALERT_MIN_LEVEL`` to the webhook, so existing ``logger.error(...)``
  call sites become alerts with no change to them.
* :func:`send_alert` — an explicit call for events worth alerting on that log
  below the handler's threshold (e.g. a ``WARNING`` balance-floor breach), which
  fires regardless of ``ALERT_MIN_LEVEL``.

Alerts go to ``ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`` and, when ``ALERT_EMAIL`` is set and the
internal SMTP relay (``SMTP_*``) is configured, to that address by email.
Everything degrades to a no-op when neither is configured: alerting is opt-in,
records still reach the logs, and a delivery outage never propagates into the
request path. Delivery runs on a daemon thread and swallows its own failures,
identical alerts are throttled so an error loop can't flood the channel, and
emails are further capped per hour because a burst of distinct errors would
otherwise become a burst of mail.

The payload is Slack's ``{"text": …}`` shape, which Mattermost and Google Chat
also accept. Discord's webhook wants ``{"content": …}`` and needs a small
translating proxy in front.
