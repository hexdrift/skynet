"""SSE endpoint for the generalist agent that drives the Skynet wizard. [INTERNAL]

Mirrors the ``code_agent`` router's shape: one streaming POST that emits
reasoning / tool / message events, plus a companion confirm POST so the
client can respond to ``pending_approval`` events (the SSE channel is
server → client only).

Persistence: when the caller is authenticated and ``job_store`` was wired
in at router construction, every turn is mirrored into the
``agent_conversations`` / ``agent_messages`` tables. The first emitted SSE
event is ``conversation_meta`` carrying the canonical conversation id so
new threads materialise without a separate round-trip.

All endpoints are hidden from the public Scalar reference (none are in
``_SCALAR_PUBLIC_PATHS``) — wizard-internal flow.
