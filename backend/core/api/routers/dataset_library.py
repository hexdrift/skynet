"""Routes for the personal dataset library — save, list, read, edit, share-aware.

A library dataset is a single saved file: lean metadata plus the row bytes
behind the :class:`DatasetBlobStore` seam (see
:mod:`core.storage.dataset_library`). These endpoints are the CRUD surface the
three producer doorways (tagger, upload page, optimization Data tab) and the
submit-wizard consumer call.

Access is tiered by :mod:`core.api.dataset_access`: a caller reaches a dataset
as its owner (the creator or an admin) or through a share grant. Reads
(metadata, rows) need ``viewer``; editing rows needs ``editor``; renaming,
deleting, and cloning-quota are owner-only — sharing management lives in
:mod:`core.api.routers.dataset_share`. The listing folds in datasets shared with
the caller alongside their own.

Saving gates on three limits, in order: the per-file compressed cap
(``settings.dataset_max_file_bytes`` → 413), content-hash dedupe (a byte-
identical re-save returns the existing entry, charged nothing), and the
per-user compressed quota (``settings.dataset_user_quota_bytes`` → 409). All
accounting is on the compressed ``stored_bytes``; the uncompressed ``byte_size``
is what the UI shows.
