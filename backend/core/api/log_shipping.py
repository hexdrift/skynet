"""Ship a copy of every log record to an HTTP log aggregator.

Railway keeps container logs for a limited window and has no native log
drain, so anything older than that window is gone unless the app forwards
it somewhere itself. :class:`LogShipHandler` does that: it turns each record
into a small JSON object, buffers it, and POSTs batches to ``LOG_SHIP_URL``
with ``Authorization: Bearer LOG_SHIP_TOKEN`` from a daemon thread.

The payload is a JSON array of ``{"dt", "level", "logger", "message", "service",
"pod", "request_id"[, "exception"]}`` objects — the shape Better Stack (Logtail)
ingests as-is, and generic enough for a Vector ``http_server`` source or any
JSON-over-HTTP intake.

Everything degrades to a no-op when ``LOG_SHIP_URL`` is unset. The handler
never blocks the caller: records go into a bounded in-memory queue and are
dropped (with a running count) when the aggregator can't keep up, and a
delivery failure discards that batch and moves on. Records emitted by this
module itself are skipped so a shipping failure can never feed back into the
queue.
