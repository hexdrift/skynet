"""Wiring tests for the public dashboard search router.

These tests stay DB-free: they monkeypatch the gateway ``search_optimizations``
with a kwargs-capturing spy and the auth resolver with a fixed identity, then
assert how ``POST /dashboard/search`` resolves and forwards the
``owner_username`` (mine) / ``shared_with_username`` (shared-with-me) scopes.
The gateway SQL itself is exercised against a live database elsewhere; here we
only pin the route's scope-resolution contract.
