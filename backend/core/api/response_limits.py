"""Shared caps and helpers to keep agent-facing responses context-safe.

Agent tool results land inside the generalist's ReAct context on every
turn. An unbounded list or a 50 KB error trace silently burns the whole
window and the agent starts to hallucinate or truncate its own output.

These helpers give every agent-tagged endpoint a single place to:

* cap list-shaped responses to a sane default even if the caller omits ``limit``,
* truncate free-form text (docstrings, logs, traces) with a "…+12KB" hint so
  the agent knows there is more via a follow-up call,
* strip pickle blobs and similar oversized fields before serialising.

Constants are deliberately small. The UI layer can opt into the full
payload with ``view=full`` where it genuinely needs every byte.
