"""Encrypt-at-rest vault for bring-your-own-key (BYOK) provider secrets.

When an account runs in ``byok`` token source, jobs use the user's own provider
connection. This module is the only place that holds those
secrets: it encrypts them with Fernet (symmetric AES) under
``settings.byok_vault_key`` before they touch the database, decrypts them only
in memory (to re-run a verify probe, hand them to a run, or list the models a
custom endpoint serves), and never returns plaintext to the API surface. The stored row keeps only the ciphertext, a masked tail (``last4``)
for display, and a verification ``status`` — so a database dump never leaks a
usable key.

The verify probe makes one lightweight authenticated request to the provider on
key entry, so a typo'd or revoked key is caught before a job ever runs rather
than failing mid-optimization. A successful probe flips the stored status to
``verified``; an auth rejection flips it to ``invalid``; a transient/network
error leaves it ``unverified`` (the probe couldn't reach a verdict, not a bad
key).

Reads of the masked metadata work whether or not the vault is configured;
anything that encrypts or decrypts (saving, re-verifying, resolving a key for a
run) needs ``settings.byok_vault_key`` and raises a 503 ``byok.not_configured``
``DomainError`` when it is unset — never a 500.
