"""Live-Postgres concurrency tests for ``RemoteDBJobStore.claim_next_job``.

These tests verify that ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` actually serializes
concurrent claimers — something SQLite cannot exercise because it lacks
row-level locking. They are gated on ``REMOTE_DB_URL`` so they only run
when an operator deliberately points the suite at a real Postgres
instance::

    REMOTE_DB_URL=postgresql://skynet:skynet@localhost:5432/skynet \
        pytest backend/core/storage/tests/test_remote_jobstore_postgres.py

Without that env var the entire module is skipped, so unit-test CI is
unaffected.
