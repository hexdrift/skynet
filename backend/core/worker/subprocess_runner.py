"""Subprocess-side entry point for DSPy optimization jobs.

Houses the code that runs inside the child process forked/spawned by
``BackgroundWorker`` — the log handler, the event-queue helpers, and
the ``_run_service_in_subprocess`` function itself. Kept in its own
module so ``engine.py`` can stay focused on the parent-side worker
lifecycle.
