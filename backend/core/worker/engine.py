"""Background worker for DSPy optimization jobs.

Threaded worker that claims pending jobs from a shared job store and processes
them with configurable concurrency. Multi-pod safety is delegated to the store:
:meth:`JobStore.claim_next_job` performs an atomic claim (Postgres uses
``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``) so two pods running side by side cannot
race on the same row.
