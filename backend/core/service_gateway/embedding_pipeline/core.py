"""Per-job embedding pipeline backing public explore search.

Pipeline:

1. After a job finishes successfully, the worker fires
   ``embed_finished_job(optimization_id, job_store)`` on a daemon thread.
2. That task: fetches the job payload, asks an LLM for a 2-3 sentence
   task summary, embeds the summary, and upserts the vector + display
   metadata (task / module / optimizer name, baseline / optimized score,
   winning model) into ``job_embeddings``.
3. ``EmbeddingIndexSweeper`` scans for missing or stale success jobs on a
   bounded, advisory-locked loop so crashed worker threads, provider outages,
   and resumed optimizations heal without requiring a restart.

Failures never raise — embedding is isolated from job completion. Missing
embedding API credentials, LLM hiccups, or a flaky pgvector connection all
degrade to "skip this job" and the row is retried by the repair loop.

Only the ``summary`` aspect is embedded. The code / schema aspects from
the original recommendations design were dropped: the explore page's only
consumer is dashboard.py, which reads ``embedding_summary`` exclusively.
