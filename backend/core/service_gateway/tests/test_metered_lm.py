"""Tests for ``MeteredLM`` usage aggregation and its history-free contract.

``MeteredLM`` replaces dspy's per-call history retention (full prompts and
responses, three lists deep) with running usage totals. These tests pin the
two properties the swap relies on: nothing is retained anywhere, and the
billing/telemetry readers see exactly the numbers the old history walk
produced — including the fallback path for plain/mocked LMs.
