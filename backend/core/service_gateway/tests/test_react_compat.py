"""Tests for the ReActV2 native-function-calling helpers.

``react_compat`` gates the optional provider-native function-calling path
behind the ``REACT_NATIVE_TOOL_CALLING`` flag. These tests exercise the native-calling
helpers without mutating the process-wide adapter, so they stay isolated from
the rest of the suite: the flag-on install path is intentionally left to the
serve-loop smoke path rather than asserted here.
