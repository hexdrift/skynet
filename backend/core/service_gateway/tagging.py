"""LLM engine for AI-assisted tagging (co-tagging). [INTERNAL]

Powers the tagger's assist modes: the dataset interview that distills a
labeling rubric, silent per-row predictions during calibration, batched
review/auto-tagging, the pre-run token estimate, and — for sessions created
without data — writing the synthetic rows the interview specified. Pure
functions over the session payload — persistence stays in the router;
nothing here touches the database.

All structured LLM outputs are JSON-in-a-string fields (the repo-wide dspy
convention) parsed defensively, with a per-row fallback when a batch reply
cannot be parsed.

    You are a labeling copilot preparing to tag the user's dataset for them.
    The user chose which columns each row's text is built from; the dataset
    summary lists the rest as excluded. Excluded columns are invisible to both
    the human tagger and the tagging model, so the task, every direction you
    offer, and every rubric rule must be decidable from the sample-row text
    alone — never propose a task that needs an excluded column.
    Ask ONE short, concrete question at a time — grounded in the sample rows —
    about ambiguous label boundaries, edge cases, and how to treat dirty or
    off-topic rows. Never ask generic questions the task description already
    answers. When the task description tells you to ask for a missing task
    definition, your first question must pin it down. After at most five
    questions total (or as
    soon as the user asks to proceed, or their answers stop adding information),
    stop asking: set
    ``done`` to true, write a one-sentence wrap-up in ``message``, and emit
    the full rubric and ``task_config_json`` — 4 to 10 crisp, decision-ready rules that would let a
    stranger label exactly like the user. Rules state decisions ("X counts as
    Y when ..."), not process. Whenever the question has a small set of likely
    answers, offer 2-4 of them in ``options_json`` — each a short pickable
    answer with a one-line description of what choosing it means — so the user
    can answer in one click. When the task description says no dataset exists
    yet, the dataset is yours to specify from the interview alone: pin down
    the data first (domain, what kind of text each row holds, the variety and
    edge cases to include, the language, how many rows), then the task, and
    when done describe that data in ``dataset_json``; otherwise leave it {}.
    Every option must be a concrete, self-contained answer. The composer under the options is always the free-text path, so
    never spend an option on an escape hatch — no "other", "something else",
    "none of these", "I use my own ...", or any rewording whose real meaning
    is "I'll type it below"; when only escape hatches would fill the list,

    ``reasoning_patch`` for provider thinking tokens (same synthetic channel
    the agents use), ``message_patch`` for reply deltas, ``message_end`` once
    the reply is fully streamed (the remaining structured fields — options,
    rubric, task — are still generating), ``turn_hint`` with ``{"final"}`` as
    soon as the streamed ``done`` field settles (the client picks the matching
    still-generating placeholder), ``message_reset`` when a failed attempt is
    being retried or leaked structure was dropped (the client must drop
    partial text and the hint), and a terminal ``interview_done`` carrying the
    parsed turn. Reply deltas pass through :class:`_MessageLeakGuard` so raw
    payload text never reaches the visible reply.

    A turn whose terminal parse fails is first salvaged from the raw response
    (minimax-class models answer in chat-adapter format even under the JSON
    fallback — see ``agents.parse_salvage``) and only then retried from
    scratch, mirroring the code interview. A finished turn that carries no
    rubric rules is retried the same way — a "done" turn without a rubric
    would hand the user an empty contract card.
