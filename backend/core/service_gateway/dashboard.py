"""Public dashboard aggregator for the anonymous /explore page (PER-11 Feature B).

Builds the corpus point list that feeds the /explore list view's count,
filters, and model/optimizer options.

1. Fingerprint check — cheap ``COUNT(*) + MAX(created_at)`` query gates the
   expensive recompute. Same fingerprint = serve cached payload.
2. Bulk fetch — every public success job's lightweight metadata. Heavy
   fields (``signature_code``, ``optimizer_kwargs``, ``metric_name``,
   ``winning_rank``, ``is_recommendable``) are not used by the explore UI
   and are dropped to keep the payload under ~5 MB (gzipped) at 100k points.
3. Cache — keyed by fingerprint, 5 min TTL.

No personal information is exposed. ``signature_code`` is dropped from the
bulk response (it is not consumed by the explore page). Jobs flagged
``is_private`` are excluded from both the fingerprint and the bulk fetch,
so they never appear in the corpus payload and do not invalidate the cache
when added.

    Mirrors :func:`_search_lexical`'s structured filters and result assembly,
    but ranks by ParadeDB ``paradedb.score`` instead of recency and surfaces a
    real ``relevance`` per row. Requires the ``pg_search`` extension and the
    ``idx_jobs_bm25`` index (created best-effort at store init); the caller only
    routes here when ``job_store.bm25_search_enabled`` is true and wraps the call
    so any failure falls back to :func:`_search_lexical`.

    Args:
        job_store: Job store exposing the SQLAlchemy ``engine`` attribute.
        query: Pre-trimmed, non-empty query string (the BM25 match text).
        models: Optional model whitelist.
        optimizers: Optional optimizer whitelist.
        optimization_types: Optional ``optimization_type`` whitelist.
        tasks: Optional ``task_name`` whitelist.
        modules: Optional ``module_name`` whitelist.
        date_from: Inclusive lower bound on ``created_at``.
        date_to: Inclusive upper bound on ``created_at``.
        page: 1-indexed page number.
        size: Page size (already clamped).
        owner_username: When set, scope to that user (including private rows).
        shared_with_username: When set (and ``owner_username`` is not), scope to
            jobs shared with that user via a member grant.

    Returns:
