    """Aggregate per-model ``(input, output)`` token usage across LMs' histories.

    The per-model companion to :func:`total_tokens_from_history`: it keys usage
    by each ``dspy.LM``'s ``model`` id and preserves the input/output split that
    operator diagnostics need, folding several LMs on the same model together.
    Prefers the ``MeteredLM`` aggregate, falling back to history entries.
    Returns plain token counts without cost or licensing policy.

    Args:
        *language_models: LMs whose usage to total; ``None`` entries and LMs
            tracking neither form are skipped. An LM with no ``model``
            attribute buckets under ``"unknown"``.

    Returns:
        A ``model id → (input_tokens, output_tokens)`` mapping, or ``None`` when
        no usage information is present anywhere — mirroring
        :func:`total_tokens_from_history` so callers can tell "zero usage" from
        "usage not tracked" and avoid recording a misleading zero.
