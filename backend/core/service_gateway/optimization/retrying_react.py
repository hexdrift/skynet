"""A ``dspy.ReActV2`` variant that resamples its loop turn on parse failures.

minimax-class models occasionally break the ReActV2 turn protocol — leaking a
``</mm:think>`` reasoning tag into the output, or short-circuiting straight to a
final message — so neither the chat nor the JSON adapter can parse the turn and
``AdapterParseError`` is raised. Stock ``ReActV2`` abandons the loop on the
first such failure; during a GEPA rollout that pins the example's reward at the
failure score, and at serve time it degrades to a forced-submit reply.

This module wraps the loop's single inner predictor so a parse failure is
retried a few times, each with a fresh ``rollout_id`` that bypasses the LM
response cache and forces a genuine resample (only effective at temperature > 0;
the production student model runs at 1.0). After the retries are exhausted the
original error is re-raised, so the stock forced-submit fallback still runs
exactly as before — the retry only ever adds attempts, never changes terminal
behavior.

Both the optimization rollout (``gepa_adapter``) and the three serve builders
(``react_serve``, ``_helpers``, ``tool_overlay``) drive the program through the
synchronous ``Predict.forward`` — serve via ``dspy.streamify``'s asyncify path,
which runs the sync loop in a worker thread — so overriding ``forward`` covers
every site.
