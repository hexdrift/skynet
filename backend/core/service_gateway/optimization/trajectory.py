"""Per-candidate event extraction from a running GEPA optimization.

GEPA persists its full state to ``<run_dir>/gepa_state.bin`` (cloudpickle) at
the start of every iteration plus once after the loop exits. This module
watches that file and converts new accepted candidates into structured
progress events the frontend can render as a genealogy tree.

Accepted candidates flow through ``state.program_candidates`` and are emitted
as :data:`PROGRESS_CANDIDATE` events. Rejected proposals are reconstructed
from ``state.full_program_trace`` — each iteration entry there carries
``selected_program_candidate`` (parent), ``subsample_scores`` (parent),
``new_subsample_scores`` (proposed), and only entries that were accepted
also carry ``new_program_idx``. Iterations with proposed scores but no
``new_program_idx`` are rejections, and we emit them as
:data:`PROGRESS_REJECTED` events.

Reflective feedback text from each metric call is captured by
:class:`MinibatchRecorder`, a metric-callable wrapper that intercepts
``dspy.Prediction`` returns carrying ``feedback`` and forwards them as
:data:`PROGRESS_MINIBATCH` events. The wrapper is composition, not
monkey-patching — callers opt in by passing the wrapped callable to the
optimizer instead of the raw metric.

      - :data:`PROGRESS_MINIBATCH` — fires when the metric returns a

        minibatch evaluation).
      - :data:`PROGRESS_VALSET_OUTPUTS` — fires once per completed full

    evaluations and no :data:`PROGRESS_VALSET_OUTPUTS` events are emitted —
    leaving the Pareto-cell "candidate prediction" panel empty even though
    per-example scores exist (those are reconstructed from ``gepa_state.bin``).
    This wrapper closes that gap: it forwards every ``evaluate`` call unchanged
    and, whenever a call covers the full validation split, emits the batch's
    predictions keyed by the candidate index the frontend tree uses.

    Attribution mirrors :class:`MinibatchRecorder`: GEPA evaluates the whole
    valset exactly once per added candidate (the seed at init, then each
    accepted candidate via ``gepa.core.engine._run_full_eval_and_add``), so a
    monotonic sweep counter lines up with ``program_candidates`` indices
    (seed = 0). Example identity is matched with ``id(example)`` against the
    same valset list handed to ``gepa.optimize``; minibatch (train-subset)
    evaluations carry no valset examples and are skipped.

    handed to ``instantiate_optimizer(log_dir=...)``. Non-GEPA optimizers
    don't use it, so no directory is created and ``None`` is yielded —
    ``instantiate_optimizer`` ignores ``log_dir`` for those.

    When ``provided_dir`` is given (the worker owns a per-job directory so it
    can persist/restore the checkpoint that backs resume), that directory is
    used and left in place on exit — its lifecycle belongs to the caller. With
    no ``provided_dir`` a fresh tempdir is created and removed on exit, the
    original ephemeral behaviour kept for callers that don't resume.

    Args:
        optimizer_name: The optimizer's registered name.
        provided_dir: A caller-owned directory to write the state into, or
            ``None`` to allocate (and clean up) an ephemeral tempdir.

    Yields:
        Absolute path to the directory GEPA writes into, or ``None`` for
        non-GEPA optimizers.
