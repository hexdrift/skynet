"""Dashboard read scenario.

Drives the read endpoints the dashboard frontend depends on
(``/optimizations``, ``/optimizations/counts``, ``/optimizations/sidebar``,
``GET /optimizations/{id}/summary``) at sustained concurrency, then briefly
opens an SSE stream against ``/optimizations/{id}/stream`` to check that
streaming routes do not regress while the read tier is hot.

Why this matters: in production every active user keeps a dashboard tab
open, so the read tier handles orders of magnitude more requests per
submission than the write tier. A regression here is the most likely
cause of "the UI hangs" reports even when submission latency looks fine.
