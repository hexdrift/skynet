/**
 * Sync active-locale resolution for the argument-free `msg()` / `tI18n()`
 * helpers, across the RSC server/client boundary.
 *
 * `msg("some.key")` is called from ~2,250 sites with no locale argument, so the
 * active locale has to be ambient rather than threaded. The two runtimes need
 * different mechanisms:
 *
 * - **Client**: a module-level variable seeded from the `window.__SKYNET_LOCALE__`
 *   shim the layout injects before hydration. The browser is single-threaded,
 *   so a mutable module global is race-free; the switcher updates it in place.
 * - **Server**: a per-request slot held by React's `cache()`, which returns a
 *   fresh object per request render. The `force-dynamic` root layout sets it
 *   once at the top of render (before any child resolves a message), so even
 *   concurrent requests for different locales never read each other's value.
 *
 * Mirrors the `runtime-env.ts` injection shim so the two `<script>` tags share
 * one shape.

 *
 * - **Client bundle** (browser AND client-component SSR): `clientLocale`, which
 *   LocaleProvider seeds before any descendant renders. Preferred whenever set,
 *   because during SSR `window` is undefined yet we still must use the request
 *   locale — the server slot lives in the *other* bundle and would read default.
 * - **Server bundle** (Server Components, `window` undefined, `clientLocale`
 *   never set because the provider only runs client-side): the per-request
 *   `cache()` slot the root layout pins.
 * - **Client first paint** before the provider mounts: seed from the injected
 *   `window.__SKYNET_LOCALE__` shim.
 *
 * Caveat: `clientLocale` is a module global, so under concurrent SSR of mixed
 * locales a client-component render could briefly observe another request's
 * value; the browser then corrects it on hydration from the per-request shim.
 * Acceptable for a Hebrew-default app where English is opt-in.
